# LaTeX Resume

This repository contains a LaTeX template for a professional resume/CV. The LaTeX source code is located in `main.tex`, and the compiled PDF version of the resume is available as `main.pdf`.

## Contents

- `resume.tex` - LaTeX source code for the resume.
- `main.pdf` - The compiled PDF version of the resume.

## Getting Started

To compile the LaTeX source code and generate the PDF, you'll need to have a LaTeX distribution installed. If you don't already have one, you can install [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/) or [MiKTeX](https://miktex.org/).

### Compiling the Resume

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/ddonazz/CV.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the repository directory:

    ```sh
        cd CV
    ```

3. Compile the LaTeX source code to produce the PDF:

    ```sh
    pdflatex main.tex
    ```

   You may need to run the `pdflatex` command multiple times to resolve cross-references and generate the final output.

## Customization

Feel free to customize the `resume.tex` file to fit your personal information and formatting preferences. You can modify sections, fonts, and layout to suit your needs.

## Preview

The `main.pdf` file is the result of compiling the LaTeX source. It provides a preview of how the resume will appear when printed or shared.
